## Contributing Code

Code contributions can be made via pull requests, and we prefer the [shared repoistory model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#shared-repository-model). Just make a branch in this repo, name it after the topic, and create a PR. 

For a background on contributing to open source, you can read the [github guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

### Azure DevOps UI
Microsoft have a set of [guidelines](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure-devops/) for devloping UIs for Azure Devops. It's a good idea to familiarise yourself with it so that you can keep the user experience consistent and high quality.

There is a [colour system](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure-devops/design-basics/color) which has a clear meaning for the use of colours, and there are a set of SASS variables you can use to keep the colours consistent.

There are also many pre-defined css classes you can use for the various compoments. Look for details on those in the usage guidelines for the specific compoment. For example the [table component styles](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure-devops/components/table#styles).
