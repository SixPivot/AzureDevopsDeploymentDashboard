## Practices and Principles

Be pragmatic, keep it as simple as possible (but no simpler), and keep to the following practices unless there is a very good reason not to.

### Code style and format

- eslint (recommened to use the vscode extension)
- prettier (use the git hook provided)

### Typescript

- Avoid using `any`.
- Avoid using `var`.
- Use interfaces.
- Write tests.
- Encouraged to use functional React components.

### UI

Microsoft have a set of [guidelines](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure-devops/) for developing UIs for Azure DevOps. It's a good idea to familiarise yourself with it so that you can keep the user experience consistent and high quality.

There is a [colour system](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure-devops/design-basics/color) which has a clear meaning for the use of colours, and there are a set of SASS variables you can use to keep the colours consistent.

There are also many pre-defined css classes you can use for the various compoments. Look for details on those in the usage guidelines for the specific compoment. For example the [table component styles](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure-devops/components/table#styles).

- Follow the design guidelines for [colour](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure-devops/design-basics/color), [content](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure-devops/design-basics/content), [depth](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure-devops/design-basics/depth), [shell](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure-devops/design-basics/shell), [spacing](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure-devops/design-basics/spacing), and [typography](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure-devops/design-basics/typography).
- Follow the usage guidelines for all components.
