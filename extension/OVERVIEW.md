# Deployment Dashboard for Pipelines

This dashboard lets you easily see an overview of all your recent pipeline deployments including:

  - Pipeline name
  - Date and time of deployments
  - Failure or success status
  - Which environments have been released to
  - Name of deployments

You’ll find this helpful if your team has:

  - Automated deployments - you’ll be able to see which ones have failed so you can re-release or-rollback/roll forward
  - Pipeline folders - you’ll have better visibility of yow many pipelines are sitting within
  - Multiple environments - you’ll be able to see which ones are on different deployments based on the name
  - Multiple components - you’ll be able deploy to the same environment
