# Deployment Dashboard for Pipelines

Hey there friend ðŸ‘‹ we built this extension out of frustration (in an internal hackathon) and thought hey-this is pretty useful. So we finished building it and polished it up. Our team like using it. Itâ€™s pretty nifty. Thought you might like it too so weâ€™ve put it here - thatâ€™s the origin story.

What is it? Well we were getting frustrated that you couldnâ€™t see an overview all your pipeline deployments. So we made this extension that adds a dashboard so you can see all your pipeline names, dates, times, status and environments in one place!

Itâ€™s nifty if you have:

- Automated deployments--youâ€™ll be able to see which ones have failed so you can re-release or rollback/roll forward
- Pipeline folders - youâ€™ll have better visibility of yow many pipelines are sitting within
- Multiple environments - youâ€™ll be able to see which ones are on different deployments based on the name
- Multiple components - youâ€™ll be able deploy to the same environment
